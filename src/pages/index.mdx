Hi, I am **Amr Bashir**, open source enthusiastic, full-stack Developer and Desktop-applications Engineer who is currently based in Tanta, Egypt.

I am also a working-group member and contributor to the [<span class="print:hidden i-simple-icons-tauri mb-2px" /> Tauri](https://tauri.app) project.

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with my systems, whether that would be customizing my operating system,
configuring my browser, ricing up my terminal or flashing a new Android ROM; often resulting in me writing
scripts or creating small applications.

Checkout [list of my projects here](/projects) or on [<span class="print:hidden i-ri-github-line" /> GitHub](https://github.com/amrbashir).

Outside of programming, I love playing Games, ever since I was a little kid, as well as football, the one actually played with your foot.

Recently, I have also picked up soldering as a hobby, and managed to add rechargeability to my Logitech G305 mouse
so it would use a li-polymer battery and a USB-C port instead of AA battery.
